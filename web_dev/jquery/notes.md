The following is my plan for learning as much about jQuery as I can within two hours.

1. Start by researching basic information about jQuery, such as a basic description of this library and its purpose. My main resource for finding websites on jQuery will be Google, but I will check the Mozilla Developer Network and w3schools.com for information, as well. They've proven to be very helpful in the past.

2. Look up jQuery code on the websites I find. I will concentrate on functions that will allow me to do the same things as programs I've written so far in Week 9.

3. Take notes and bookmark pages that seem especially helpful. For example, if I find a list of the most commonly used types of jQuery code, I should keep it handy. Examples of how functions work are also important.

4. Test jQuery functions for myself. As noted above, I will try to replicate the code I've written so far for Week 9 assignments.
