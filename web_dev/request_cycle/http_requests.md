What are some common HTTP status codes?

-100 Continue is a code meaning the client should continue with its request.

-200 OK, as noted in the video, means a request has succeeded.

-202 Accepted means a request has been accepted, but not acted upon.

-300 Multiple Choice means the request has more than one possible response, and one of these should be chosen by the user.

What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

-A GET request means the resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.

-A POST request means the resource describing the post of the action is transmitted in the message body.

-A GET request is likely being used whenever a client retrieves information from a server.

-A POST request might be used if a user needed more information on the data returned by a server and how it was transmitted or rendered.
