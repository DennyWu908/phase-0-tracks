# Allow a user to input a name, and split the name into an array of two words.

agent = gets.chomp.split(' ')

# Reverse the order of the words, then split them into letters.

agent.rotate(1)

# Convert the array into a string.

# Change each vowel to the next vowel in the alphabetical order.

# Change is consonant to the next consonant in the alphabetical order.

# Print the new name.

# Note: I was unable to write a method using the algorithm described. I have decided to complete the assignment based on the alternate set of
# instructions. The method below will convert each letter in a name to the next letter in alphabetical order.
# Below is the psuedocode for this method, along with the actual code.
